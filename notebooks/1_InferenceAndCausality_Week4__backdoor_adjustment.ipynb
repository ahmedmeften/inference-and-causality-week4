    "### 1. Theory: Back-door criterion\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1 The Problem: Confounding\n",
    "We want to estimate a causal effect like $P(Y \\mid do(X=1)) - P(Y \\mid do(X=0))$. This represents the difference in the probability of $Y$ when we **intervene** to set $X=1$ versus when we set $X=0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why can't we just use observational data?**  \n",
    "If there is a confounder $Z$ that affects **both** $X$ and $Y$, then the naive association $P(Y \\mid X)$ is biased. This is because:\n",
    "- $Z$ influences both $X$ and $Y$\n",
    "- When we observe $X=1$, we're likely also seeing cases where $Z$ takes certain values\n",
    "- This creates a spurious (non-causal) association between $X$ and $Y$ through the path $X \\leftarrow Z \\rightarrow Y$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Imagine $X$ = ice cream sales, $Y$ = drowning incidents, and $Z$ = temperature. Hot weather ($Z$) causes both more ice cream sales ($X$) and more swimming/drowning ($Y$), creating a spurious association between ice cream and drowning.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2 The Solution: Back-door Criterion\n",
    "**Back-door criterion (Pearl):** A set of variables $Z$ satisfies the back-door criterion (for the effect of $X$ on $Y$) if:\n",
    "1. **No variable in $Z$ is a descendant of $X$**  \n",
    "   (We don't want to condition on variables that are caused by $X$, as this would block the causal effect we're trying to measure)\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **$Z$ blocks every path from $X$ to $Y$ that starts with an arrow into $X$**  \n",
    "   (These are the \"back-door\" paths that create confounding)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is a back-door path?**  \n",
    "A back-door path is any path from $X$ to $Y$ that starts with an arrow **into** $X$ (i.e., $X \\leftarrow ...$). These paths represent spurious associations, not causal effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.3 The Back-door Adjustment Formula\n",
    "If $Z$ satisfies the back-door criterion, we can identify the causal effect using:\n",
    "$$P(Y \\mid do(X=x)) = \\sum_z P(Y \\mid X=x, Z=z) \\cdot P(Z=z)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**  \n",
    "- We stratify the population by levels of $Z$\n",
    "- Within each stratum (each value of $Z$), we compute the association between $X$ and $Y$\n",
    "- We then take a weighted average across strata, where weights are the probabilities $P(Z=z)$\n",
    "- This effectively \"removes\" the confounding influence of $Z$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intuition:** By conditioning on $Z$, we compare units with the **same value** of $Z$, ensuring that differences in $Y$ are due to $X$, not $Z$."
